## 0.1.1-beta - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Deployment guide for local and Streamlit Community Cloud use.
- Cross-package validation contract for TAM, sirt, mirt, FACETS-like, and ConQuest-style comparisons.

### Validation

- `make verify` passed with 18 built-in self-tests, 2 pytest checks, benchmark smoke, and parity fixture export.
- GitHub Actions passed on Python 3.11 and 3.12 for the validation-protocol commit.

## 0.1.0-beta - 2026-04-12

Initial public-beta repository setup.

### Added

- Standalone single-file Streamlit app for Many-Facet Rasch Model workflows.
- RSM, PCM, bounded GPCM, JMLE, MML EM/Direct/Hybrid/Auto, latent regression, plausible values, prediction, simulation, strict marginal diagnostics, residual PCA, anchor audit, and linking review workflows.
- Data privacy warning in the app and README.
- `st.cache_data` / `st.cache_resource` usage for built-in sample data, static bundled assets, read-only core namespace, and bounded export-byte caches.
- Reproducibility/config fingerprints in exported analysis metadata.
- `--doctor`, `--self-test`, `--benchmark-quick`, and `--export-parity-fixture` CLI paths.
- CI smoke workflow for Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- Validation scaffold for optional TAM, mirt, and sirt external checks.
- Anchor templates and a user guideline.
- MIT license file.

### Validation

- Local compile, doctor, self-test, AppTest, benchmark smoke, parity fixture export, optional R scaffold, fresh virtual environment install/self-test, and Streamlit health checks were run during repository preparation.

### Caveats
