# Changelog

All notable changes to this standalone Streamlit distribution should be recorded here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Beginner-facing visual interpretation checklist in the app and downloadable report bundle.
- PCM/GPCM category probability curves can now be inspected by selected step-facet level, not only as averaged curves.
- Category probability curve exports now use the same curve builder as the Visuals tab and include long-form data for all curve scopes.
- Synthetic beginner-facing demo report export through `--export-demo-report`, including report tables, method appendix, and interactive category curves.
- Visual method evidence table plus readability safeguards for dense Wright maps, yardsticks, marginal heatmaps, and bias heatmaps.
- Latent-regression covariate type preview and export table for numeric, categorical, and integer-code review decisions.
- Public-beta limitation and release-readiness tables in the app, demo report export, and CLI release check.
- mfrmr 0.1.5 migration coverage table plus external validation artifact checklist, official-reference table, and reviewer template in the parity fixture.
- README preview screenshot generated from the real Streamlit app using built-in synthetic sample data.
- Archived local R cross-check smoke status for generated TAM, mirt, and sirt handoff fixtures.
- Result-aware manuscript claim guide in the Report tab, table downloads, and demo report export.
- Result-aware Markdown manuscript template for Methods, Results, limitations, reviewer preflight checks, and OSF/demo report exports.

### Changed

- App version label now marks post-0.1.1 development as `0.1.2-beta-dev`.
- Plotly/Kaleido floors now target Kaleido 1.x PNG export behavior, with HTML figure fallback when Chrome/Chromium is unavailable.
- Final-report readiness, first-read guidance, and report text now use the same residual, reliability, and PCA thresholds.
- New/held-out prediction session-state invalidation now fingerprints uploaded file content, not only file name and size.
- Uploaded CSV/TSV reads are now non-destructive, so sidebar previews do not consume the file stream before estimation.
- `make verify` now includes `python streamlit_app.py --release-check`.
- The optional R cross-check scaffold now records package versions and output file manifests for archived validation evidence.

### Validation

- `make verify` passed with 21 built-in self-tests, 9 pytest checks, release check, benchmark smoke, demo report export, and parity fixture export.

## 0.1.1-beta - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Deployment guide for local and Streamlit Community Cloud use.
- Cross-package validation contract for TAM, sirt, mirt, FACETS-like, and ConQuest-style comparisons.

### Validation

- `make verify` passed with 18 built-in self-tests, 2 pytest checks, benchmark smoke, and parity fixture export.
- GitHub Actions passed on Python 3.11 and 3.12 for the validation-protocol commit.

## 0.1.0-beta - 2026-04-12

Initial public-beta repository setup.

### Added

- Standalone single-file Streamlit app for Many-Facet Rasch Model workflows.
- RSM, PCM, bounded GPCM, JMLE, MML EM/Direct/Hybrid/Auto, latent regression, plausible values, prediction, simulation, strict marginal diagnostics, residual PCA, anchor audit, and linking review workflows.
- Data privacy warning in the app and README.
- `st.cache_data` / `st.cache_resource` usage for built-in sample data, static bundled assets, read-only core namespace, and bounded export-byte caches.
- Reproducibility/config fingerprints in exported analysis metadata.
- `--doctor`, `--self-test`, `--benchmark-quick`, and `--export-parity-fixture` CLI paths.
- CI smoke workflow for Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- Validation scaffold for optional TAM, mirt, and sirt external checks.
- Anchor templates and a user guideline.
- MIT license file.

### Validation

- Local compile, doctor, self-test, AppTest, benchmark smoke, parity fixture export, optional R scaffold, fresh virtual environment install/self-test, and Streamlit health checks were run during repository preparation.

### Caveats

- Release status is public beta / research preview.
- Exact numerical parity with FACETS, TAM, sirt, mirt, or `mfrmr` is not claimed.
- Licensed under MIT.
