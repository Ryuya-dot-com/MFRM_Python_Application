# Changelog

All notable changes to this standalone Streamlit distribution should be recorded here.

## Unreleased

### Added — Phase A (publication export)

- Word (.docx) publication document builder with auto-generated abstract,
  exhaustive Methods (estimator / priors / anchor policy / convergence
  criteria / unused-category handling), manuscript-style Results,
  embedded figures (Wright map, fit scatter, category probability curves,
  facet distribution), core tables (element measures, reliability), and
  an APA 7 reference list. Runs lazily via `python-docx` (new dependency).
- PDF publication document builder with the same structure rendered as a
  letter-size reportlab platypus flowable stack (hanging-indent
  references, 6-inch figure embeds, 8 pt table styling). The PDF
  excludes the reproducibility code appendix per the monolith's public
  beta convention; use the Word export for code-bearing variants.
- HTML publication document builder (`build_publication_html_bytes`):
  self-contained single-file HTML with inline CSS, base64 figure embeds,
  and a minimal markdown → HTML converter. Works offline with no external
  assets.
- APA 7 reference-list generator (`collect_cited_references`,
  `build_apa_reference_list`) keyed by the narrative's `(Author, Year)`
  citations, with an always-include anchor set so every publication
  document carries the foundational Rasch references (Andrich 1978,
  Masters 1982, Linacre 1989 / 2024, Myford & Wolfe 2003 / 2004,
  Smith 2002, Wright & Masters 1982).
- New Report tab sub-tab "📄 Publication Document" exposing three
  download paths (Word / PDF / HTML) from identical narrative sources.
- Inline self-tests: `_self_test_apa_reference_list`,
  `_self_test_publication_document_word`,
  `_self_test_publication_document_pdf`.

### Added — PCA + bias/reliability silent-fail diagnostics

- `diagnose_pca_skip_reason` surfaces exactly why residual PCA was
  skipped (small person count, too few item-combinations, all-NaN
  columns, NaN share above 95%, exception, or an Analysis depth that
  disabled PCA) instead of the previous silent "PCA is not available"
  fallback. The Dimensionality tab reads the stored reason and shows
  it with concrete fix suggestions.
- `estimate_bias_interaction` now returns a `_skip_reason`-carrying
  dict on every early-return path (missing result / diagnostics, empty
  observation table, same-facet pair, unknown facet names, no valid
  cells after filtering). `show_bias_section` surfaces the reason
  instead of crashing on the missing `table` key.
- `calc_reliability` records a `ReliabilityNote` column explaining
  why Separation / Reliability is NaN for a given facet ("only N
  level", "all levels have identical measures", "SE zero or NaN",
  "measurement variance ≤ error variance").

### Added — UX layer (st.status, error remedy, readiness, history, comparison)

- Replace the plain `st.spinner` with an expandable `st.status`
  accordion that writes step-by-step progress (Estimate → Diagnostics
  → Report tables → Bias interactions) and the final elapsed seconds.
- Replace the generic estimation "common causes" checklist with a
  pattern-matched diagnosis → action guide
  (`diagnose_estimation_error`): singular matrix → non-centered facet,
  maxit reached → `maxit=1000`, rating scale error → Score column
  check, memory error → reduce facet cardinality, anchor error →
  fix anchor tables, etc. Falls back to the generic list for
  unrecognised failures.
- Pre-estimation data-quality readiness panel above the Run button
  (`build_readiness_report`, `render_readiness_panel`) with a
  🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴 traffic-light summary across eight checks (observation
  count, person count, score column dtype, facet count, per-facet
  level count, per-person coverage, column-role overlap).
- Dismissible onboarding banner with a "🎯 Run with sample data"
  one-click quickstart that fires estimation with the built-in
  sample dataset and default column mapping.
- Session-scoped run history (`record_run_in_history`,
  `render_run_history_panel`) caps the last 10 runs and offers a
  Restore button per entry plus a "🗑 Clear history" control.
- Two-run comparison panel (`render_comparison_panel`,
  `render_comparison_selector`) on top of the history stack:
  convergence / iterations / elapsed delta, element-level Pearson r
  + RMSE scatter with a 45° reference line, facet-level reliability
  diff table, and an automatic interpretation ribbon
  (near-perfect / strong / moderate / weak agreement).

### Dependencies

- Added `python-docx >= 1.0` (Word publication export).
- Added `reportlab >= 4.0` (PDF publication export).

## 0.1.2-beta - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Beginner-facing visual interpretation checklist in the app and downloadable report bundle.
- PCM/GPCM category probability curves can now be inspected by selected step-facet level, not only as averaged curves.
- Category probability curve exports now use the same curve builder as the Visuals tab and include long-form data for all curve scopes.
- Synthetic beginner-facing demo report export through `--export-demo-report`, including report tables, method appendix, and interactive category curves.
- Visual method evidence table plus readability safeguards for dense Wright maps, yardsticks, marginal heatmaps, and bias heatmaps.
- Latent-regression covariate type preview and export table for numeric, categorical, and integer-code review decisions.
- Public-beta limitation and release-readiness tables in the app, demo report export, and CLI release check.
- mfrmr 0.1.5 migration coverage table plus external validation artifact checklist, official-reference table, and reviewer template in the parity fixture.
- README preview screenshot generated from the real Streamlit app using built-in synthetic sample data.
- Archived local R cross-check smoke status for generated TAM, mirt, and sirt handoff fixtures.
- Result-aware manuscript claim guide in the Report tab, table downloads, and demo report export.
- Result-aware Markdown manuscript template for Methods, Results, limitations, reviewer preflight checks, and OSF/demo report exports.
- Publication gate summary that aligns APA Report conclusions with readiness checks and manuscript claim guardrails.
- Case-specific beginner guidance for sparse categories, dimensionality, bias screens, MML marginal checks, rater reliability, and linking claims.
- Result-specific avoid/safer wording repairs in APA Report guidance, manuscript templates, and beginner case-guide exports.
- Submission action plan that combines publication gates, readiness checks, claim guardrails, and wording repairs into a prioritized first-read table.
- Desktop readability refinements for result-tab wrapping, wrapped guide tables, and dense or tightly spaced Wright map / yardstick labels.
- Publication-styled figure export bundle with 300 DPI PNG target, matching HTML figures, and a figure-use manifest.
- Local Simulation-directory validation inventory for external numerical validation planning without bundling private data or local absolute paths.
- Sanitized Python/R/Julia external Simulation validation templates, downloadable from the app, OSF/demo report exports, and parity fixture exports.

### Changed

- App version label now marks this public beta release as `0.1.2-beta`.
- Plotly/Kaleido floors now target Kaleido 1.x PNG export behavior, with HTML figure fallback when Chrome/Chromium is unavailable.
- Final-report readiness, first-read guidance, and report text now use the same residual, reliability, and PCA thresholds.
- APA Report summary wording now respects claim-guide caveats and avoids broad no-bias claims outside computed screens.
- New/held-out prediction session-state invalidation now fingerprints uploaded file content, not only file name and size.
- Uploaded CSV/TSV reads are now non-destructive, so sidebar previews do not consume the file stream before estimation.
- `make verify` now includes `python streamlit_app.py --release-check`.
- The optional R cross-check scaffold now records package versions and output file manifests for archived validation evidence.

### Validation

- `make verify` passed with 21 built-in self-tests, 10 pytest checks, release check, benchmark smoke, demo report export, and parity fixture export.
- GitHub Actions passed on Python 3.11 and 3.12 for the final pre-release template commit before version finalization.

## 0.1.1-beta - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Deployment guide for local and Streamlit Community Cloud use.
- Cross-package validation contract for TAM, sirt, mirt, FACETS-like, and ConQuest-style comparisons.

### Validation
